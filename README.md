# Image-classification-Alexnet-Tensorflow
Image classification based on Alexnet-Tensorflow and SVM.
Please understant that images are removed because of privacy. For test images you could use corns images in https://github.com/QiyuanMa/Image-classification-SVM-ML

# Introduction
This project provides a image classification model based on Alexnet-tensorflow and compared it with SVM. 
The accuraty is 0.87, but you should adjust the parameters for your images.

# Usage
Run run.py, you should run train(), generate_pre_result(), evaluation_eval_dataset() individually. And evaluation_eval_dataset is only for result visualization.

# Results
(1)The generated txt, which is for providing images locations for further steps.
